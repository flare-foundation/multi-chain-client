# Multi-Chain Client

Welcome to MCC.

## What is the MCC?

MCC or Multi-Chain Client is a Typescript library that allows querying nodes from any blockchain in a unified manner. Retrieved data is encapsulated in objects that hold all the original information and allow adding static, named properties.
